# COSMIC-PULSES
"Sound Architecture Machine"-Explore the Interactive Relationship between Sound, Human Activities and Architecture

## INTRODUCTION
Architecture space always serves human beings, and the main task of architects is to design spaces that are suitable for human beings. But does the so-called “human-friendly” space designed by architects really meet people’s needs? Therefore, the adaptability of space should be determined by people’s activities in the space.

Why human beings need to move in architecture space, they need a purpose to pull them to generate motivation, so human beings and architecture need a motivation or a factor to coordinate. Music is a great factor. 1970s, the birth of avant-garde music, avant-garde music composers usually use symbolic notation to record the notes, melody, and rhythm, etc., the music creates new graphic combinations of characteristics, and graphics also form a new music, the music is also a new graphic combination of characteristics. The music created new graphic combinations and the graphics created new musical forms, an interaction that can be translated to music, architecture and human activity. Nature is boundless, it symbolizes freedom, similar to the freedom of movement in architecture space, so eco-accoustic is a kind of musical freedom of movement.
